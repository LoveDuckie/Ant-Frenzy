## Deprecation Notice

This project is extremely old and will likely not run without making some significant changes to the dependencies of the project. It was originally developed as a Windows 8 application, so I imagine that most of the project dependencies will have to changed to target both the latest framework for the Windows App Store, as well MonoGame Framework libraries. You've been warned!
